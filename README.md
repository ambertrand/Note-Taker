## Developer Notes:
For this project I was tasked with developing the back-end of this note taker app using express.  After having a pretty good understanding of express from the previous week I was able to get the app up and running fairly easily.  I did recieve some help from another classmate on finding the uuid package that creates random id's for each note so that was very helpful.
